    "summary": "Blockchain technology offers promising solutions for secure and transparent voting systems. This thesis evaluates various blockchain platforms to assess their suitability for implementing secure e-voting protocols. By creating a prototype system, the research demonstrates how features like decentralized ledgers and cryptographic security can ensure voter anonymity and integrity. The study also addresses scalability and user accessibility, identifying key hurdles and proposing optimizations for wider adoption.",
